  overview: |
    A privacy-preserving image encryption system that divides images into multiple random XOR shares.
    Each share appears as noise and reveals no data independently. When all valid shares are combined,
    the original image is perfectly reconstructed. The system achieves strong confidentiality with fast execution.

  key_highlights:
    - "Pixel-level XOR encryption ensures irreversible data obfuscation."
    - "Supports flexible multi-share generation (3 or more shares)."
    - "High reconstruction quality (PSNR > 35 dB)."
    - "Ultra-fast processing (~0.002 s per image)."
    - "Zero information leakage from individual shares."

  tech_stack:
    language: "Python"
    libraries: ["NumPy", "OpenCV", "Matplotlib"]
    environment: "JupyterLab / VS Code"

  results:
    psnr: "> 35 dB"
    encryption_time: "0.002 s/image"
    leakage: "0%"

  applications:
    - "Secure medical image transmission"
    - "Encrypted cloud and defense data storage"
    - "Privacy-preserving AI datasets"

  learnings:
    - "Built a complete XOR-based visual encryption pipeline."
    - "Optimized security and performance for real-time encryption."
    - "Integrated mathematical cryptography with AI validation."

  recruiter_highlights:
    impact: "Developed a high-speed, mathematically secure image encryption model ensuring zero leakage."
    outcome: "Demonstrated perfect reconstruction with minimal computational cost."
